*As the site isn’t bilingual, I’ve tucked the English version of the welcome page here — a little pocket of Shakespeare’s language for curious travelers. 
Follow the links in the text to wander through the rest of the translations.*

_The Art of Being offers a poetic and practical exploration of existence — in zigzags, in silence, and sometimes, in socks._

This site is for those who see the world differently.  
For those who feel deeply, think sideways, and trip over norms like loose rugs.  
For those who’ve never quite understood what “living normally” is supposed to mean —  
yet still, bravely, keep trying to dance their way through life, rather than just think it through.

## This little travel journal contains four pages.  
Here’s the order I suggest, to help you find your way:

### • [About](/about)
Before setting off on any adventure, it’s wise to check your compass.  
Here, I share the “why” behind the journey.

### • [Bundle](/baluchon)
What I carry in my backpack as an explorer of the present moment —  
my anchors, to keep from being swept away in life’s whirlwind.

### • [Blog](/blog)
This is my logbook.  
I jot down the bumps and potholes, the forks in the road,  
the unexpected clearings — and the fog of existence.

### • [Gallery](/galerie)
You know those strange little objects you sometimes find in attics — or dreams?  
This is where they speak.  
Welcome to my cabinet of curiosities, where every piece whispers its own story —  
if you’re willing to listen.  
_(Sometimes you have to press your ear close, like you’re listening to the sea in a shell.)_  
My childhood dream, all grown up — but still wide-eyed.
