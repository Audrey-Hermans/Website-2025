*(For sensitive souls and other sailors of everyday entropy)*

If I had to keep just one lesson from recent years, it would be this: **travel light**.

It’s taken me years—and a few existential crises—to sift through the thousands of things I’m passionate about.  
After much tidying, tossing, restarting and dramatic sighing, I finally managed to distil the essentials into a small bundle I now carry with me everywhere.

So here it is: my personal kit for navigating existence.  
It’s only mine, of course, but I hope it might inspire you to put together your own, with your own special ingredients.

To help you pack yours, I suggest three magical questions *(no wand required)*:

- Does it nourish me… or drain me?  
- Could I go without it for more than a week?  
- Does it give me a sense of wholeness *(or at least that feeling you get when you find a matching pair of socks on a Monday morning)*?


## A Tale of Shakuhachi *(bless you)*

Everyone talks about the importance of breath.  
Very few think to pick up a flute and find out how it actually works.

I play the **shakuhachi**, a Japanese bamboo flute once used by Zen monks in pursuit of spiritual awakening.  
Well, I’m still stuck somewhere between “snooze” and “slow awakening,” but one thing’s certain:  
I’ve never found a better way to check the weather inside myself without triggering a full-blown storm.

Playing the shakuhachi means getting acquainted with your breath. Not the one you wish you had, but the one that’s really there, in the moment.  
It’s like a martial art of self-kindness.

It might sound lofty… but after all, breath rises from deep within us, so why wouldn’t it carry a few truths along the way?

I often struggle to identify what I am really feeling, underneath all the “shoulds” and expectations.
The shakuhachi changed that.
I even started a [YouTube channel](#) to talk about it. Imagine that.

## A Deck of Cards

So here’s the thing.  
Don’t burn me at the stake, but my method for seing through myself involves… **a Tarot de Marseille**.

Yes, I know.  
And no, I don’t tell the future. I read the present and believe me, that’s already enough of an adventure.

I always keep a mini tarot deck in my pocket.  
It’s like a personal translator when I’m lost in the noise of daily life.  
It whispers things like, *“You’re feeling anger, not guilt, you know.”*
And I go,*“Ah, I see. Thanks.”*

If you sometimes struggle to tell the difference between what you think you want and what you actually need given the circumstances, the tarot can be incredibly helpful to attune yourself to daily situations without losing your mind.  
It allows the unconscious to speak out loud in its favourite language : images.

## A Pencil for Spontaneous Expression

A pencil might seem like a silly thing.  
But it taught me something vital:  
*when you love doing something, do it for yourself.*

- Not for it to to be "well done".  
- Not for validation.  
- Just because it brings joy to your heart.

A shout-out here to Max, Serge, and Jérôme, who each— in their own way—taught me to recognise the beauty of raw, unfiltered aliveness.

## Silence at the Bottom of Your Pockets

If you’re anything like me, your pockets probably hold a stone, a shell, or a bit of bark brought back from a walk.  
Maybe even a book, if your pockets are particularly ambitious.

These objects have a quiet but powerful gift: **they bring us back to ourselves through touch**.

Over time, my bundle has become a kind of **anchoring toolkit**.  
Nowadays, I never leave home without my survival kit:

- noise-cancelling headphones  
- tinted glasses  
- a scarf  
- and a beanie or hat

Gear to soften sensory overload and create a little cocoon, even in the middle of chaos.

At first, it was a semi-conscious defence mechanism.  
But one day, I realised how much these objects helped me, and just how vulnerable I felt without them.

Maybe you’ve got some of your own, without even thinking about it.  
Come to think of it… **have you ever asked yourself?**
